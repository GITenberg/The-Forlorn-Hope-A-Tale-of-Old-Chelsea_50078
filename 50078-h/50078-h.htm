class="smcap">Chelsea</span> Hospital, or, as the old soldiers
prefer to call it, &ldquo;Chelsea College,&rdquo; appears much
the same at all seasons of the year; its simple, dignified, and,
if the phrase may be permitted, healthful and useful, style of
architecture, suggests the same ideas, under the hot sun of June
and amid the snows of bleak December; bringing conviction that
the venerable structure is a safe, suitable, comfortable, and
happy, as well as honourable, retreat for the brave men who have
so effectually &ldquo;kept the foreigner from fooling
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; The simple story I have to tell, commences with
a morning in April, 1838.&nbsp; It was a warm, soft morning, of
the first spring month; the sun shone along the colonnade of
&ldquo;the Royal College.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some of the
veterans&mdash;who, fearing rheumatism more than they ever feared
cold steel or leaden bullet, had kept close quarters <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>all the winter,
in their comfortable nooks up stairs&mdash;were now slowly pacing
beside the stately pillars of their own palace, inhaling the
refreshing breeze that crossed the water-garden from the Thames,
and talking cheerfully of the coming summer.&nbsp; Truly the
&ldquo;pensioners&rdquo; seem, to the full, aware of their
privileges, and of their claims&mdash;far less upon our
sympathies than upon our gratitude and respect.&nbsp; The college
is <span class="GutSmall">THEIRS</span>; they look, walk, and
talk, in perfect and indisputable consciousness that it is their
house, and that those who cross its courts, loiter in its
gardens, or view its halls, chapel, and dormitories, are but
visitors&mdash;graciously admitted, and generously instructed by
them.&nbsp; And who will dare to question their right?</p>

<p>The veterans are, as they may well be, proud of their country
and their hospital; they are too natural to disguise the feeling
that they love a good listener; to such they will tell how Madam
Gwyn asked the king&mdash;the second Charles&mdash;to endow a
last earthly home for his brave soldiers; and how rejoiced she
was to have it built at Chelsea, because she was born there, for
that all human souls love the places where they were born!&nbsp;
They point to the tattered flags in the noble hall and sacred
chapel, as if the trophies were actually won by their own hands;
they will digress from them to Sir Christopher Wren, not seeming
to know very clearly whether the great architect or Charles the
Second planned the structure&mdash;they are apt to confound Henry
the Eighth with the second James, who presented to their church
such splendid communion plate; but make no mistake at all about
Queen Victoria, who came herself to see them&mdash;&ldquo;God
bless her Majesty!&rdquo;&nbsp; I never met one who was not proud
of his quarters; they praise the freshness and sweetness of the
air, the liberality of the treatment, and point out, with
gratitude, their little gardens which occupy the site of the
famous Ranelagh of fashionable memory, where they can follow
their own fancies, cultivating, in their plots of ground, the
flowers, or herbs, or shrubs that please them best; <span
class="GutSmall">THE SUMMER-HOUSE</span>, which they say Lord
John Russell built for them, occupies a prominent position there;
it was worthy a descendant of the noble house of Bedford to care
for brave soldiers in the evening of their days.&nbsp; If you
have patience, and feel interested in the cheerful garrulities of
age, they will hint that they fear the new embankment of
&ldquo;The Thames&rdquo; will still more dry up the land-springs,
<a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>and injure
their fine old trees.&nbsp; Some can describe the ancient conduit
which supplied Winchester Palace and Beaufort House with water,
and point out (if you will extend your walk so far) the various
sites of houses in the immediate vicinity, where dwelt the great
men of old times,&mdash;chiefest among them all, the wise Sir
Thomas More, Lord High Chancellor of England, who lived
&ldquo;hard by,&rdquo; and had for his near neighbours the Earl
of Essex, the Princess Elizabeth; and, farther down, at Old
Brompton, Oliver Cromwell and Lord Burleigh.&nbsp; But those who
would know more than the pensioners can tell them concerning
Chelsea, and its neighbourhood&mdash;that suburb of London most
rich in honourable and interesting associations with the
past&mdash;may consult good Mr. Faulkner, the accurate and
pains-taking Historian of the district, who lives in a small
book-shop near at hand, flourishing, as he ought to, in the very
centre of places he has so effectually aided to commemorate.</p>

<p>The story of &ldquo;Mistress Nelly&rsquo;s&rdquo; prayer that
an asylum might be provided for aged veterans, &ldquo;whose work
was done,&rdquo; rests mainly on tradition; but there is nothing
of improbability about it.&nbsp; Her influence over the
voluptuous monarch,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Who never said a foolish thing<br />
And never did a wise one,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>was, at one period, unbounded.&nbsp; It was in this instance,
at least, exerted in the cause of mercy and virtue, as well as
gratitude; the College remains a lasting contradiction to the
memorable epigram I have quoted; inasmuch as a &ldquo;wiser
thing&rdquo; than its foundation, to say nothing of its justice,
is not recorded in the chronicles of the reign of any British
sovereign.&nbsp; Many a victory has been won for these kingdoms
by the knowledge that the maimed soldier will not be a deserted
beggar&mdash;by the certainty that honourable &ldquo;scars&rdquo;
will be healed by other ointment than that of mere pity!&nbsp;
Chelsea and Greenwich are enduring monuments to prove that a
Nation knows how to be grateful.&nbsp; The brave men who pace
along these corridors may &ldquo;talk o&rsquo;er their
wounds,&rdquo; and while shouldering their crutches, to
&ldquo;show how fields were won,&rdquo; point to the recompense
as a stimulus to younger candidates for glory.&nbsp; Who can
sufficiently estimate the value of this reward?&nbsp; Let us ask
what it has done for our country; but let us ask it on the battle
fields, where French eagles were taken: eagles, <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>a score of
which are now the trophies of our triumphs, in the very halls
which the veterans, who won them, tread up and down.</p>
<p>The pensioners&mdash;though, as human beings, each may have a
distinctive character&mdash;are, to a certain degree, alike;
clean and orderly, erect in their carriage for a much longer
period than civilians of equal ages, and disputing all the
encroachments of time, inch by inch&mdash;fighting with as much
determination for life as formerly they did for glory.&nbsp; When
they die, they die of old age.</p>

<p>The month I have said was April&mdash;the April of 1838: old
James Hardy and John Coyne were walking beneath the colonnade
that faces the water-garden.&nbsp; They were both old, yet John
considered James a mere boy.&nbsp; John&rsquo;s face had been
&ldquo;broken up&rdquo; by a gun-shot wound at Seringapatam,
which anticipated time; and James &ldquo;stumped&rdquo; very
vigorously along on a brace of wooden legs, his eyes bright and
twinkling, his laugh ringing out, at the conclusion of each of
his brief, pithy stories, which he told as earnestly as if John
could hear them; John, however, <i>had</i> heard them all before
he became deaf, and as James only re-drew upon his ancient store,
John had no great loss.&nbsp; He looked up in his comrade&rsquo;s
face, caught the cheerful infection of his comrade&rsquo;s laugh,
by sight though not by sound, and laughed also&mdash;not as James
laughed, but in a little quiet way, something like the rattle of
a baby&rsquo;s drum&mdash;and then James would wind it up by
saying&mdash;&ldquo;There! did you ever hear the like of that
before!&rdquo; and bestow a sounding slap on his friend&rsquo;s
shoulder.&nbsp; They were comrades in every sense of the word,
for they inhabited the same dormitory, nest by nest; John
cherishing a canary, whose song he had never heard, though he
used to declare it sang like a nightingale, with a
woodlark&rsquo;s note&mdash;while James had ranged all manner of
curious crockery on the shelf over his bed, filling up the
intermediate spaces with caricatures of the French, the iron head
of a halbert, the buckle of a French cuirass, a fragment of an
ensign&rsquo;s gorget, and a few other reliques of a
&ldquo;foughten field,&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The treasures of a soldier, bought with
blood,<br />
And kept at life&rsquo;s expense.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As they strutted lovingly together, delighting, as children
do, in sunshine, while James talked and laughed incessantly, a
tall, thin, military-looking man, as hard and erect as a ramrod,
marched up to them, with as measured a tread as if he were in the
ranks; then, <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>wheeling about, presented James with a leaf of laurel,
one of many he held in his hand; there was a wild sparkle in his
eyes, and a bright flush upon his cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for, serjeant-major?&rdquo; inquired James, taking
the leaf, and giving a military salute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toulouse!&rdquo; answered the veteran, in a voice of
triumph; yet the tone was full of music, and rendered ample
justice to the musical word.&nbsp; &ldquo;Toulouse! my old
fellow,&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is!&rdquo; answered James Hardy; &ldquo;it is the
anniversary, sure enough.&nbsp; And yet, master, if we are to
mount a fresh laurel for every day we gained a victory, we shall
have to get as many as there are days in the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, Hardy, right,&rdquo; replied the
sergeant-major.&nbsp; &ldquo;Right; three hundred and sixty-five
laurel-leaves per annum.&nbsp; Right, that was well said.&nbsp;
Lucy walked out this morning and gathered me a basketful; she
knew I&rsquo;d want them for my old comrades, as soon as I could
get down to the college.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s worthy to be a
soldier&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, ah! and a soldier&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; responded
James; &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t she, John?&rdquo;&nbsp; And John,
thinking James had been telling a story, laughed his little laugh
as usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worthy to be anything, thank God,&rdquo; said the
sergeant-major; but the expression of his face changed; it lost
its flush and its proud glance of triumph; anxiety for his only
child obliterated even the memory of
&ldquo;Toulouse:&rdquo;&mdash;the soldier was absorbed in the
father,&mdash;and he continued, &ldquo;No: I should not like her
to be a soldier&rsquo;s wife, Jem, I should not; she hasn&rsquo;t
strength for campaigning.&nbsp; It killed her poor mother; they
said it was consumption; but it was no such thing.&nbsp; It was
the wet and dry, heat and cold, ups and downs of campaigning; she
would not leave me&mdash;not she: it is a wonderful thing, the
abiding love that links a frail, delicate woman to the rough
soldier and his life of hardships; and such a loving mother as
she had, and such a home; she never heard anything louder than
the ripple of the mountain rill, and the coo of the ringdove,
until, a girl of seventeen, she plunged with me into the hot
war.&nbsp; You remember her, Jem?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
sergeant-major&rsquo;s seventeen years of widowhood had not dried
up the sources of his grief; he drew his hand across his eyes,
and then began, hastily and with a tremulous hand, to fit the
laurel leaves, which he still held, one within the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I do&mdash;remember her&mdash;and well;&rdquo;
answered James Hardy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; inquired old John.&nbsp; James made
him understand they were speaking of poor Mrs. Joyce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;she was an
angel,&mdash;Miss Lucy is very like her mother&mdash;very like
her&mdash;even to the way she has in church of laying her hand on
her heart&mdash;so,&mdash;as if it beat too fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does not do <i>that</i>, does she, James?&rdquo;
inquired the sergeant-major, eagerly; &ldquo;I never saw her do
<i>that</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>&ldquo;Likely not,&rdquo; replied James; &ldquo;John sees
a deal more than those who hear; he is obliged to amuse himself
with something; and, as he cannot hear, he sees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sergeant-major paused, and his companions with him; he
became abstracted&mdash;the leaves dropped from his
fingers&mdash;and, at last, turning abruptly away, he retraced
his steps homewards.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Old John touched his brow with his forefinger significantly,
and James muttered to himself&mdash;&ldquo;The wound in his head
may have damaged the sergeant-major, to be sure,&mdash;but, it is
his daughter, poor thing, for all the roses on her cheek, and her
sweet voice&mdash;!&rdquo;&nbsp; John did not hear a word his
comrade spoke, but his thoughts were in the same channel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He loves to see us all the same,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as
when he was with the old &lsquo;half-hundred,&rsquo; and takes a
march through the college every morning, keeping wonderful count
of our victories; and then mounts guard over his daughter, as
regularly as beat of drum;&mdash;he&rsquo;s constant with her; if
the sun&rsquo;s too hot, under the shade of the avenue trees; or,
if it is too cold, in the warmth of Cheyne-walk, or with old Mr.
Anderson in the botanic garden, gathering the virtues of the
herbs, and telling each other tales of the cedars and plane trees
of foreign parts; may be, looking through the old water gate, or
at the statue of Sir Hans Sloane. <a name="citation6"></a><a
href="#footnote6" class="citation">[6]</a>&nbsp; I hear tell that
Miss Lucy has great knowledge of such things; but she&rsquo;ll
not live&mdash;not she&mdash;no more than her mother; I&rsquo;m
sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; said James Hardy, &ldquo;if she
had a milder climate, or proper care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! the poor sergeant-major!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s always
leading some forlorn hope!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sergeant-major was one of <span
class="GutSmall">EIGHTY-THREE THOUSAND MEN</span> who are
pensioned by a grateful country; an honourable
boon&mdash;honourable alike to &ldquo;those who give, and those
who take.&rdquo;&nbsp; A wound in the head had rendered him, at
an early period of life, unfit for future service, and he had
taken up his quarters in his native village, only to watch by the
dying bed of a beloved wife, who, after a few years of gradual
decline, left him the fatal legacy of a child as delicate as
herself.</p>
<p>Of all the evils that wait on poor humanity, the most sad and
the most hopeless, in its progress and its result, is that
disease which may be described as peculiar to our climate; acting
as a dreadful counterpoise to numerous blessed privileges; the
one terrible &ldquo;set-off&rdquo; against the plague, the
pestilence, the famine, the storm, the earthquake, the wars,
which so continually devastate other countries, but from which a
merciful Providence has, in a great degree, exempted ours.&nbsp;
The raging fever of the blood or the brain, brings the suspense
of but a week or two, and busies the mournful watcher; all the
ills that &ldquo;flesh is heir to&rdquo; have inseparably linked
with them some sources of consolation, some motives for hope;
they may be borne by the sufferer, and by those who often suffer
more intensely than the patient, because of the knowledge that
skill and care are mighty to save.&nbsp; But <span
class="GutSmall">CONSUMPTION</span>&mdash;lingering, wasting,
&ldquo;slow but sure&rdquo;&mdash;when the victim has been marked
out, the work is, as it were, done!&nbsp; The hectic cheek is as
a registered death-doom from which there is no appeal!</p>
<p>Should I not, rather, say that, <span
class="GutSmall">HITHERTO</span>, it has been so
considered:&mdash;the Despair engendered by a belief that
&ldquo;all hope&rdquo; was to be &ldquo;abandoned,&rdquo;
having&mdash;no one can doubt it&mdash;largely aided in
preventing cure.</p>
<p>The poor sergeant-major! strong and brave as a lion though he
was,&mdash;a single word had made him feeble as a child.&nbsp; He
had defied death, when death assumed appalling shapes; but the
memory of his wife&rsquo;s sufferings was ever a sudden chill
upon his heart; he shrank, as at an adders&rsquo;s touch, from
the thought that his child might be the inheritor of the
mother&rsquo;s fatal dowry.&nbsp; Thus, the sound of a hollow
cough would shake his rugged nature like an ague fit; his very
life was bound up in that of his dear daughter; <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>and, for a
moment, the thought that there might be truth in what his aged
comrade said, seemed as awful in its consequences as an actual
death-knell.</p>
<p>Sergeant-major Joyce was a veteran soldier, who had gained the
respect and esteem of his whole regiment officers and men.&nbsp;
There was a bond between him and them which his withdrawal from
active service could not cancel.&nbsp; So, after his wife&rsquo;s
death, finding that a few of his old companions in arms were
inmates of Chelsea College, he removed to its vicinity; passing
his time between the lofty corridors of the palace-hospital and
the small sitting-room of his child; ever walking with and
talking to &ldquo;the pensioners,&rdquo; or that dear and
delicate &ldquo;copy&rdquo; of the wife he had so truly
loved.&nbsp; And Lucy was a girl of whom any parent might have
been proud.&nbsp; Delicacy of constitution had given refinement
to her mind as well as to her appearance: she read, perhaps, more
than was good for her, if she had been destined to live the usual
term of life, in her proper sphere.&nbsp; She thought, also, but
she thought well; and this, happily for herself, made her
humble.&nbsp; Faith is the foundation of that righteous
affection, without which nought is pure; her faith was clear and
firm&mdash;in nothing wavering; <span class="GutSmall">SHE
BELIEVED</span>, and belief had given her, without an effort,
tenfold the strength which those who rely for strength upon the
broken and bending reed of <span class="GutSmall">HUMAN
REASON</span>, seek for in vain.&nbsp; You inquire, who taught
her this?&nbsp; Was it her kindly but half-crazed father?&nbsp;
No: he was full of a rough soldier&rsquo;s honour, mingled, at
times, with the more than woman&rsquo;s softness, which often
tempers dispositions fierce as his; but in all this faith, in the
trust and purity, the meek, cheerful, warm spirit of love and
tenderness, Lucy&mdash;I say it with deep reverence&mdash;Lucy,
in all these things&mdash;the fruits of a regenerate
nature&mdash;was taught of <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp;
She made no show of piety; but her father knew that every night
her Bible was placed beneath her pillow; for he had often seen it
there, when stealing into her little room to be assured she
slept.&nbsp; She read much besides, and had that youthful leaning
towards poetry which is often the sure evidence of a good and
highly tempered mind; but many a time she shut her &ldquo;poesy
book&rdquo; with something like distaste, to fill out her heart
with the inspired numbers of Isaiah, or the glories of the holy
Psalms.&nbsp; Well might she be her father&rsquo;s darling; she
was more than that, though he did not know it; she was his
ministering angel.&nbsp; At times her heart would throb wildly at
tales of the wars in which he had borne a part.&nbsp; And even on
the sabbath day she seldom knelt beneath the shadow of the
trophies of our country&rsquo;s prowess&mdash;trophies which
glorify the old Hospital-Chapel of Chelsea&mdash;without feeling
proudly thankful they were there; but her care was ever to soothe
and tranquillize, to watch for and avert her father&rsquo;s
stormy moods, and be ready with a word in season, to recall him
to himself.</p>
<p>Mr. Joyce soon reached his home after he left his
comrades.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; he inquired of an Irishwoman,
the widow of a soldier, who had nursed his daughter from <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>her birth, and
never left them&mdash;one of those devotees&mdash;half-friend,
half-servant&mdash;which are found only among the Irish:
&ldquo;Mary, did you ever perceive that Lucy pressed her hand
upon her heart&mdash;as&mdash;as&mdash;her mother used to
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it her heart?&nbsp; Ah, then, did ye ever know any
girl, let alone such a purty one as Miss Lucy, count all out
twenty years without feeling she had a heart,
sometimes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sergeant-major turned upon the faithful woman with a
scrutinizing look; but the half-smile, the total absence of
anxiety from her features, re-assured him; long as Mary had lived
in his service, he was unaccustomed to her national evasions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it tould you about her heart bating,
masther?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was old John Coyne, who said she pressed her hand
thus&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it ould John?&rdquo; repeated the woman; &ldquo;ould
John that would sware the crosses off a donkey&rsquo;s
back?&nbsp; Ah, sure! you&rsquo;re not going to b&rsquo;lieve
what ould John says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think she is quite well, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was singing like the first lark in spring after you
went out, sir, and I never see her trip more lightly than she did
down to the botany garden, not two minutes agone; unless you
quick march, you&rsquo;ll not overtake her.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Joyce wheeled round in his usually abrupt manner, and Mary stood
at the door, shading the sun from her eyes with her hand, until
he was out of sight.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hate to have him look at me
that way,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;seeing right through and
through a body, more than what&rsquo;s in them!&nbsp; The bird of
his bosom, poor man, may wear it out awhile, but not for
long&mdash;and it&rsquo;s himself that will be lost then!&nbsp;
But where&rsquo;s the good of looking out for sorrow; its heavy
and hard enough when it comes: may the Lord keep it off as long
as it&rsquo;s good for us; and it <i>is</i> hard to fancy so
bright a crathure marked for death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary returned to her work&mdash;and the old sergeant-major
overtook his daughter, just as she had lifted her hand to pull
the great bell of the botanic garden.&nbsp; He said it would be
pleasanter to stroll along Cheyne-walk, over <span
class="smcap">the old bridge of Battersea</span>.</p>

<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>So over
the old bridge they went; resting now and then upon the worn
ballustrades of the rough structure, to gaze over the bosom of
the richest and most glorious&mdash;to my thinking, I may add,
the most calmly beautiful&mdash;of all the rivers of the
world.&nbsp; Standing upon this bridge, a forest of masts is seen
in the distance;&mdash;indications of the traffic which brings
the wealth of a thousand seaports to our city quays.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The mighty heart&rdquo; of a great Nation is sending
thence its life-streams over earth.&nbsp; Glorious and mighty,

<p>are washing the banks of many a lordly villa and cottage,
where the hands of industry are busied every day.&nbsp; And
within sight, too, are places memorable in the annals of
&ldquo;holiday folk.&rdquo;&nbsp; How closely linked with
remembrances of hosts of &ldquo;honest citizens,&rdquo; is
&ldquo;the Red House, at Battersea,&rdquo;&mdash;relic of those
ancient &ldquo;tea-gardens,&rdquo; which even now are beginning
to belong to the history of the past.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pleasant
village of Chelsea,&rdquo; how abundant is its treasure of
associations with the olden time!&nbsp; Not a house is there, or
within view of it, to which some worthy memory may not be
traced.&nbsp; Alas! they grow less and less in number every
day!</p>

</a></p>
<p>But I have made a long digression from my story.&nbsp; During
their walk the old soldier narrowly watched his child, to
ascertain if she placed her hand on her heart, or her side; but
she did not.&nbsp; She spoke kindly to the little children who
crossed their path; and the dogs wagged their tails when they
looked into her face.&nbsp; She walked, he thought, stoutly for a
woman; and seemed so well, that he began talking to her about
sieges, and marches, and of his early adventures; and then they
sat down and rested; Lucy getting in a word, now and then, about
the freshness and beauty of the country, and the goodness of God,
and looking so happy and so animated that her father forgot all
his fears on her account.&nbsp; Many persons, attracted by the
fineness of the day, were strolling up and down Cheyne-walk as
the father and daughter returned; and a group at the entrance to
the famous Don Saltero Coffee-house, regarded her, as she passed,
with such evident respect and admiration, that the sergeant-major
felt more proud and happy than he had done for a very long
time.&nbsp; In the evening, he smoked his long inlaid foreign
pipe (which the little children, as well as the &ldquo;big <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>people&rdquo;
of Chelsea, regarded with peculiar admiration,) out of the
parlour window.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p11b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Lucy and her father"
title=
"Lucy and her father"
 src="images/p11s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Lucy always brought him his pipe, but he never smoked it in
the room, thinking it made her cough.&nbsp; And then, after he
had finished, he shut down the window, and she drew the white
muslin curtain; those who passed and repassed saw their shadows:
the girl bending over a large book, and her father seated
opposite to her; listening while she read, his elbow placed on
the table, and his head resting on his hand.&nbsp; The drapery
was so transparent that they could see his sword and sash hanging
on the wall above his hat; and the branch of laurel with which
Lucy had adorned the looking-glass that morning in commemoration
of the battle of Toulouse.&nbsp; Before the sergeant-major went
to bed that night he called old Mary, and whispered, &ldquo;You
were quite right about old John Coyne.&nbsp; Lucy never marched
better than she did to-day; and her voice, both in reading, and
the little hymn she sung, was as strong as a trumpet.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll give it well to old John, to-morrow;&rdquo;&mdash;but
he never did.&nbsp; The sergeant-major was usually up the first
in the house; yet, the next morning, when Mary took hot water to
his room she stepped back, seeing he was kneeling, dressed, by
his bed side; half an hour passed; she went again.&nbsp; Mr.
Joyce had never undressed, never laid upon the bed since it had
been turned down; he was dead and cold; his hands clasped in
prayer.&nbsp; Some of the vessels of the heart, or head, had
given way; the wonderful machine was disturbed; its power
destroyed in an instant.</p>
<p>Lucy Joyce was now utterly alone in the world; of her
father&rsquo;s relatives she knew little or nothing; her mother
was an only child, and her grandmother and grandfather were both
dead.&nbsp; A generous and benevolent lady, aware of the
circumstance under which she was placed, offered to provide Lucy
with a situation;&mdash;but what situation?&nbsp; She looked too
delicate, too refined for service; and she was not sufficiently
accomplished to undertake the duties of even a nursery governess,
&ldquo;Have none of their slavery, dear,&rdquo; exclaimed poor
Mary, while weeping bitterly; &ldquo;take your pick of the things
to furnish two little rooms, Miss Lucy, and sell the rest.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve a power of friends, and can get constant work; turn my
hand to any thing, from charing to clear-starching, or if the
noise wouldn&rsquo;t bother you, sure I could have a <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>mangle; it
would exercise me of on evening when I&rsquo;d be done work:
don&rsquo;t lave me, Miss, don&rsquo;t darling, any way, till you
gather a little strength after all you&rsquo;ve gone through; the
voice of the stranger is harsh, and the look of the stranger is
cold, to those who have lived all their days in the light of a
father&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; I took you from your mother&rsquo;s
breast a wee-some, woe-some, babby, and sure, my jewel own, I
have some right to you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll never gainsay you.&nbsp;
And to please you, dear, I&rsquo;ll listen to any chapter
you&rsquo;ll read out of the Book; nor never let the echo even of
a white, let alone a black, oath cross my lips.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
Lucy Joyce was too right-minded to live on the labour of an old
servant.&nbsp; She retained barely enough to furnish for Mary a
comfortable room, and accepted, much to the faithful
creature&rsquo;s mortification, a &ldquo;place&rdquo; in a
family&mdash;one of the hardest &ldquo;places&rdquo; to endure,
and yet as good, perhaps, as, from her father&rsquo;s position,
she could have expected&mdash;as half-teacher, half-servant; a
mingling of opposite duties; against the mingling of which,
reason utterly revolts; inasmuch as the one must inevitably
destroy the influence of the other.</p>

</a></p>
<p>It was not in the thick atmosphere of the crowded
city&mdash;where the most healthful find it difficult to breathe,
and where the panting sufferer&rsquo;s agony is increased
fourfold&mdash;that Lucy undertook the duties and labours of her
new occupation; her way lay through the venerable and picturesque
<span class="smcap">old village of Fulham</span>, and so, beneath
the arch and over the &ldquo;wooden way,&rdquo; to Putney.&nbsp;
Pleasant and happy the sister villages looked; divided by the
noble Thames, and joined by the bridge&mdash;the most primitive
of all the bridges which cross the broad river.&nbsp; Mary walked
respectfully behind; but, now and then, spoke words of
encouragement, while the tears ran down her cheeks.&nbsp; They
paused to look down upon the water, so broad and glassy, athwart
whose bosom the long light <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>boats were sporting; the clock of
Putney church struck the hour, and Lucy remembered that, for the
first time in her life, she was bound to note its chime as the
voice of an employer.&nbsp; The <span class="smcap">village of
Putney</span> was soon passed; yet not without some difficulty to
the poor girl; her chest heaved and panted as she endeavoured to
walk lightly up the rising ground towards the Heath, where her
future home was situated; poor Mary whispering, &ldquo;Take it
asy, dear; don&rsquo;t hurry yourself, avourneen.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They parted at the gate.</p>

<p>Time would pass almost unregistered by us, but for the
abruptness of some of its movements.&nbsp; Every country has its
great national <i>datas</i>, which fix a period.&nbsp; Of late,
in France, &ldquo;the revolution,&rdquo; and &ldquo;three
glorious days;&rdquo; in Ireland, &ldquo;the ninety-eight;&rdquo;
in Scotland &ldquo;the forty-five;&rdquo; in England, &ldquo;the
restoration,&rdquo; &ldquo;the riots.&rdquo;&nbsp; These stormy
doings are History&rsquo;s high places.&nbsp; Yet events which
effect changes as entire and as wonderful, continue untalked
about or unthought of, because they have not been heralded by
beat of drum, and written in fields of slaughter.&nbsp; So, in
private life, time would pass for ever unregistered by us, but
for the abruptness of some of its movements&mdash;things that
seem either to stop its course or send it dashing forward.&nbsp;
The most humble have their &ldquo;great events&rdquo;&mdash;their
mental land marks.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was just before I was
married,&rdquo; or &ldquo;immediately after our eldest boy was
born,&rdquo; is the frequent observation of the wife and
mother.&nbsp; The widow says, &ldquo;before my husband
died.&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor Lucy, when the sufferings of pain were
increased by the <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>anxieties of duty, and retrospection was forced upon
her, could only say, or think, &ldquo;when my dear father was
alive,&rdquo;&mdash;that was her land mark!&nbsp; The duties
incident to her new position; the exertion which children
require, and which is <i>perpetual</i>, though parents are the
only persons who do not feel it to be so; the exercise, the
necessity for amusing and instructing the young, the
high-spirited, and the active; these added to the change of
repose for inquietude, of being the one cared for, to the having
to care for others; the entire loneliness of spirit, all combined
to make her worse, to crush utterly the already bruised reed.</p>
<p>Lucy was fully sensible of the consoling power&mdash;the great
<span class="GutSmall">PLEASURE</span> of being useful; and her
mind was both practically and theoretically Christian; so, she
never yielded to fretfulness or impatience; she knew that,
through all her trials&mdash;through her waking hours of pain,
through the weary time of total incapacity for the fulfilment of
her duties&mdash;God was with her, was her stay, was her support;
was trying her, as pure gold is tried in the fire; would sustain
her in spirit unto the end: she knew all this, she never doubted,
but she suffered; her heart fluttered like an imprisoned bird, as
she toiled and panted up the high stairs, while the children
laughed and sported, with the spirit and energy of health, and
called to her to &lsquo;come faster.&rsquo;&nbsp; Night brought
rest without refreshment; she could not sleep; and, stifling her
cough, lest she should disturb others, she would look up to the
starry sky, often repeating&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Oh! that I had
wings like a dove;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but hardly had she so prayed, when a sense of her own
unworthiness, of the duty of watching and waiting for God&rsquo;s
appointed time, would come upon her, and she would add,
&ldquo;Not my will, but Thine be done.&rdquo;&nbsp; No one was
cruel, no one even unkind to her; the cross cook (all good cooks
are cross), would often make her lemonade, or reserve something
she thought the young girl might eat; the lady&rsquo;s-maid, who
had regarded her, at first, as a rival beauty, won by her
cheerful patience, said, that even when her eyes were full of
tears, there was a smile upon her lip; all the servants felt for
her; and, at length, her mistress requested her own physician to
see what was the matter with &ldquo;poor Joyce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are exceptions, no doubt; but, taken as a body, medical
men&mdash;God bless them for so being!&mdash;are the very souls
of kindness and generous humanity; how many have I known whose
voices were as music in a sick chamber; who, instead of taking,
gave; ever ready to alleviate and to sustain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you no friends?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None, sir,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;at least none to
support me; and,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I know I am unable to
remain here.&rdquo;&nbsp; While she said this, she looked with
her blue, truthful, earnest eyes, into his face; then paused,
hoping, without knowing what <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>manner of hope was in her, that he
would say&mdash;&ldquo;she <i>was</i> able;&rdquo; but he did
not; and she continued, &ldquo;there is no one to whom I can go,
except an old servant of my poor father&rsquo;s; so,
if&mdash;&rdquo; there came, perhaps, a flush of pride to her
cheek, or it might be she was ashamed to ask a
favour&mdash;&ldquo;if, sir, you could get me into <span
class="GutSmall">AN HOSPITAL</span>, I should be most
grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;with all my
heart.&nbsp; We have hospitals enough; yet, I fear&mdash;indeed,
I know&mdash;there is not one that would receive you, when aware
of the exact nature of your complaint.&nbsp; You must have a
warm, mild atmosphere; perfect quiet, and a particular diet; and
that for some considerable time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother, sir,&rdquo; said Lucy, &ldquo;died of
consumption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but you are not going to die,&rdquo; he replied,
smiling; &ldquo;only you must let your father&rsquo;s old servant
take care of you, and you may soon get better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucy shook her head, and her eyes overflowed with tears; the
physician cheered her, after the usual fashion.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
not afraid of death, sir,&rdquo; said the young woman;
&ldquo;indeed, I am not; but I fear, more than I ought, the
passage which leads to it; the burden I must be to the poor
faithful creature who nursed me from my birth.&nbsp; I thought
there was an hospital for the cure of every disease; and this
consumption is so general, so helpless, so tedious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very thing,&rdquo;&mdash;said the doctor, who, with
all his kindness, was one of those who think &ldquo;so and
so,&rdquo; because &ldquo;all the faculty&rdquo; thought
&ldquo;so and so,&rdquo; for such a number of
years;&mdash;&ldquo;its being tedious is the very thing; it is
quite a <span class="GutSmall">FORLORN HOPE</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; answered the soldier&rsquo;s daughter,
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Forlorn hopes</span> <i>have sometimes
led to</i> <span class="GutSmall">GREAT VICTORIES</span>, <i>when
they have been</i> <span class="GutSmall">FORLORN</span>, <i>but
not</i> <span class="GutSmall">FORSAKEN</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor pressed into her hand the latest fee he had
received, and descended the stairs.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is a very
extraordinary girl, madam, in the nursery,&rdquo; he said to the
lady, &ldquo;something very superior about her; but she will get
worse and worse; nothing for her but a more genial climate,
constant care, perfect rest, careful diet: if she lives through
the winter she must go in the spring.&nbsp; Lungs! chest!
blisters will relieve her; and if we could produce the climate of
Madeira here for a winter or so, she might revive; but, poor
thing, in her situation&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady shook her head, and repeated, &ldquo;Ay; in her
situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is really frightful,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;the
hundreds&mdash;thousands, I may say&mdash;who drop off in this
dreadful disease; the flower of our maidens; the finest of our
youths; no age, no sex, exempt from it.&nbsp; We have only casual
practice to instruct us in it; we have no opportunity of watching
and analyzing it, <i>en masse</i>, as we have with other
complaints; it is turned out of our hospitals before we do what
we even fancy might be done; it is indeed, as she said just now,
&lsquo;<i>forlorn</i>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<i>forsaken</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Why, I know not; I really
wish some one would establish an hospital for the cure, or, at
least, the investigation of <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>this disease; many, if taken in time,
would be saved.&nbsp; Suffering, the most intense, but, perhaps,
the best endured, from the very nature of the complaint, would be
materially lessened, and a fresh and noble field opened for an
almost new branch of our profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The physician prescribed for Lucy.&nbsp; He saw her again, and
would have seen her repeatedly, but the family left town
suddenly, in consequence of the death of a near relative, and the
very belief that nothing could be done for her, circumstanced as
she was, contributed to her being forgotten.&nbsp; The human mind
has a natural desire to blot out from memory objects that are
hopeless.&nbsp; Lucy went to Mary&rsquo;s humble lodging, and
fancied, for a day or two, she was much better.&nbsp; She had the
repose which such illness so naturally seeks.&nbsp; Mary&rsquo;s
room was on the ground floor of a small house, in a little street
leading off &ldquo;Paradise-row.&rdquo;&nbsp; The old pensioners
frequently passed the window; she could hear the beat of the
Asylum drums; sometimes they awoke her out of her sleep in the
morning; but she liked them none the less for that.&nbsp; Mary
put away her poor master&rsquo;s hat (which she brushed every
morning), his sword and sash, and his gloves, in her own box,
when Lucy came, least the sight of them should make her
melancholy; but Lucy saw their marks upon the wall, and begged
she would replace them there.&nbsp; She gave her little store,
amounting to a few pounds, into the nurse&rsquo;s hands, who
spent it scrupulously for her&mdash;and yet not prudently; for
she ran after every nostrum, and insisted upon Lucy&rsquo;s
swallowing them all.&nbsp; Sometimes the fading girl would creep
along in the sunshine, and so changed was she, in little more
than a year, that no one recognised her, though some would look
after her, and endeavour to call to mind who it was she so
strongly resembled.</p>
<p>The only living thing that rejoiced with Mary over her return,
was a lean, hungry dog, the favourite of an out-pensioner who
died about six months before the sergeant-major.&nbsp; It was
ill-favoured, but faithful, remaining many nights upon its
master&rsquo;s grave.&nbsp; Lucy coaxed it home and fed it; and
though the creature&rsquo;s erratic disposition prevented its
accepting the refuge she then offered, he would come in
occasionally for a night&rsquo;s lodging, or a breakfast, and
depart without a single wag of his stunted tail.&nbsp; When Lucy
left Chelsea, Mary almost lost sight of the dog, though she met
him sometimes, and then he would look to her&mdash;a sort of
recognition&mdash;and walk on.&nbsp; The morning after
Lucy&rsquo;s return, while she lay upon her nurse&rsquo;s bed,
the door was poked open by a thick, grizzled nose, and in another
instant the pensioner&rsquo;s dog rushed to her, expressing his
joy by the most uncouth sounds and motions, screaming while
licking her hands, and, when his excitement subsided, lying down
inside the door, with his eyes fixed upon her, baffling all
Mary&rsquo;s efforts to turn him out.&nbsp; Beauty, after all,
has very little to do with the affections; after its first sun
stroke, it loses most of its power.&nbsp; Lucy had the keen
appreciation of the beautiful which belongs to a refined mind in
every situation of life; yet the gratitude of that poor ugly dog
attached her to him; through all her <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>sufferings, when her nurse was out at
work, he was a companion, something to speak to.&nbsp; The little
store was soon expended, though Mary would not confess it; Lucy,
skilled in the womanly craft of needlework, laboured unceasingly;
and, as long as she was able to apply to it, Mary found a market
for her industry.&nbsp; But as the disease gained ground, her
efforts became more feeble, and then the faithful nurse put forth
all her strength, all her ingenuity, to disguise the nature of
their situation; the expense of the necessary medicine,
inefficient as it was, would have procured her every alleviating
Comfort&mdash;<span class="smcap">if there had been an
Institution to supply it</span>.</p>
<p>I have often borne testimony to that which I have more often
witnessed&mdash;the deep, earnest, and steadfast fidelity of the
humbler Irish! yet I have never been able to render half justice
to the theme.&nbsp; If they be found wanting in all other good or
great qualities, they are still true in this&mdash;ever faithful,
enduring, unwearied, unmoved; past all telling is their
fidelity!&nbsp; The woman whose character I am now describing,
was but one example of a most numerous class.&nbsp; Well she
would have known, if she had given the matter a thought, that no
chance or change could ever enable Lucy to repay her services, or
recompence her for her sacrifices and cares; yet her devotion was
a thousand times more fervent than if it had been purchased by
all the bribes that a kingdom&rsquo;s wealth could yield.&nbsp;
By the mere power of her zeal&mdash;her earnest and utterly
unselfish love&mdash;she obtained a hearing from many governors
of hospitals; stated the case of &ldquo;her young lady,&rdquo; as
she called her, the child of a brave man, who had served his
country, who died before his time, from the effects of that
service; and she, his child, was dying now, from want of proper
treatment.&nbsp; In all her statements, Mary set forth everything
to create sympathy for Lucy, but, nothing that tended to show her
own exertions; how she toiled for her, night and day; how she was
pledging, piece by piece, everything she had, to support her; how
her wedding-ring was gone from off her finger, and the cherished
Waterloo medal of her dead husband (which, by some peculiarly
Irish effort of the imagination, she said &ldquo;was his very
picture&rdquo;) had disappeared from her box.&nbsp; She whispered
nothing of all this, though she prayed and petitioned at almost
every hospital for medicine and advice.&nbsp; Dismissed from one,
Mary would go to another, urging that &ldquo;sure if they could
cure one thing they could cure another, anyhow they might
try;&rdquo; and if she, the beloved of her heart, was raised up
from a bed of sickness, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s fresh blessing&rdquo;
would be about them, day and night.&nbsp; &ldquo;They got up
hospitals,&rdquo; she would add, &ldquo;for the suddenly struck
for death; for the lame, and the maimed, and the halt, and the
blind; for the vicious! but there were none to comfort those who
deserved and needed more than any!&nbsp; She did not want them to
take her darling from her.&nbsp; She only asked advice and
medicine.&rdquo;&nbsp; She implored for nothing more.&nbsp; The
Irish never seem to feel ashamed of obtaining assistance from any
source, except that which the English fly to, as their <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>legitimate
refuge&mdash;the Parish; and Mary would have imagined she heaped
the bitterest wrong upon Lucy, if she had consulted &ldquo;the
parish doctor;&rdquo; thus, her national prejudice shut her out
from the only relief, trifling as it might have been, which she
could obtain for the poor girl she so tenderly cherished.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p18b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>Mary had such an aversion to the &ldquo;Poor-house&rdquo; that
she would go round the public road rather than pass the rambling
building close to the burying-ground, where the Chelsea poor find
shelter; and was never beguiled but once to look through the gate
at the Workhouse in the Fulham Road.&nbsp; It was formerly the
residence of the second Lord Shaftesbury; where Locke, and other
great men of his time, congregated.&nbsp; &ldquo;I stopped to
look in at it, Miss Lucy, dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;through a
fine ould ancient gate&mdash;and the flower-pots, up the steps,
were filled with beautiful flowers&mdash;and an old
residenter&mdash;a blind woman, that a slip of a girl held by the
hand, was standing on the top; and there came out a fine-dressed
lady, for all the world like a full-blown trumpet; and the dark
woman courtesied, and asked lave to &lsquo;come
out&rsquo;&mdash;think of one craythur asking another for lave to
breathe the air of heaven outside an ould gate!&mdash;and, I
suppose she got it, for the lady in red threw some words at her,
and she gave another courtesy, and came down the steps&mdash;her
and the girleen.&nbsp; I had seen enough, and turned away, for my
heart was full.&nbsp; I have never lived in slavery, and, plase
God, I won&rsquo;t die in it, Miss Lucy&mdash;and none I love
shall ever be <i>behoulden</i> to a parish.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
reasoning&mdash;more of the heart than of the head.&nbsp; And
yet, who can say that poor Mary was very wrong?&nbsp; True, that
a roof shelters, and food keeps in existence the English pauper;
but all the feelings that are cherished and honoured without the
workhouse walls, are insulted and uprooted within; the holy law
of wedded life&mdash;the command, what God hath joined let not
man separate&mdash;is there outraged; fifty years have that aged
man and woman paid the tithe and the tax; half a century have
they laboured honestly; the grave has closed over their children
and their early <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>friends, and they are forced to durance in the poor
man&rsquo;s prison; but they must no longer quench their thirst
from the same cup, or pray beside the same couch; the law of man
divides what can be re-united only in the presence of the
Creator!&nbsp; No wonder then, if, like poor Mary, many turn away
from unjust judgment, and resolve not to &ldquo;die in
slavery,&rdquo; having been guilty of no sin but that of being
poor.&nbsp; Oh! but it is a grievous augmentation of evil when
sympathy is diverted from its natural channel, and the sufferer
is taught daily the sad knowledge that to want is to be
criminal.</p>
<p>And so the fell disease, pale and ghastly, stalked on,
grasping its panting and unresisting victim, closer and more
close; wasting her form&mdash;infusing the thirsty fever into her
veins&mdash;parching her quivering lips into
whiteness&mdash;drawing her breath&mdash;steeping her in
unwholesome dews&mdash;and, at times, with a most cruel mockery,
painting her cheek and lighting an <i>ignis fatuus</i> in her
eyes, to bewilder with false hopes of life, while life was
failing!&nbsp; Sometimes she would talk of this life as if it
were everlasting, and&mdash;looking over a worn memorandum-book
of her father&rsquo;s, in which all the battles <i>he</i> was
engaged in were chronicled after a soldier&rsquo;s fashion; the
day of the month noted, the name of the place, which added
another to our wreath of glories, illuminated by the colours of
his regiment rudely indicated by a star or an
&ldquo;<i>hurra</i>,&rdquo; in a peculiarly cramped
hand&mdash;she would become excited, and weave imaginary
trophies, calling to her broken-hearted nurse to bring her the
green laurel which her father loved to distribute among his
comrades; these fever fits, however, were at long intervals, and
brief; gradually as &ldquo;the spring,&rdquo; the physician had
spoken of, advanced, the mingled hopes of this world, which are
but as the faint shadowings of the great <span
class="GutSmall">HEREAFTER</span>, strengthened and
spiritualized; and her thoughts were prayer, prayer to Him the
Saviour and Redeemer; prayerful and patient she was, gentle and
grateful; her perceptions which had been, for a time, clouded,
quickened as her end drew near; she saw the furniture departing,
piece by piece; at last she missed her father&rsquo;s sash and
sword; and when poor Mary would have framed excuses, she placed
her quivering fingers on her lips, and spoke more than she had
done for many days.&nbsp; &ldquo;God will reward you for your
steadfast love of a poor parentless girl; you spared <i>my
treasure</i> as long as you could, caring nothing for yourself,
working and starving, and all for me.&nbsp; Oh, that the world
could know, and have belief in the fervent enduring virtues that
sanctify such rooms as this, that decorate bare walls, and make a
bright and warming light when the coal is burnt to ashes, and the
thin candle, despite our watching, flickers before the night is
done.&nbsp; I have not thought it night, when I felt your hand or
heard you breathe.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh! what liberal charities are
there of which the world knows nothing!&nbsp; How generous, and
how mighty in extent and value, are the gifts given by the poor
to the poor!</p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>It is
useless as well as painful to note what followed; she faded and
faded; yet the weaker her body grew, the clearer grew her mind,
the more deep became her faith; she would lie for hours,
sleepless, with her eyes fixed on what we should call
vacancy&mdash;but which, to her, seemed a bright world of angels,
with the Redeemer in the midst&mdash;murmuring prayers, and
broken fragments of hymns, and listening to words of peace which
no ear but her own could hear&mdash;her mind only returning to
this world to bless Mary, when she came from her daily toil, or
with the fruits of that solicitation, which she employed for her
sake, to the last.&nbsp; The dog, too, the poor old dog, that had
partaken of her bounty, shared in her poverty, and would stand
with his paws on the bed, looking with his dim eyes into her
face, and licking her hand whenever she moved or moaned.</p>

<p>It was again the anniversary of the battle of Toulouse, and
Lucy remembered it; she begged the old woman not to leave her;
<i>it would be her last day</i>; her mind wandered a little; and
then she asked for a bough of laurel&mdash;and to sit
up&mdash;and Mary went out to seek for a few green leaves.&nbsp;
As she past hastily along, she met James Hardy stumping joyously
onwards, and talking to himself, as if poor old John Coyne, who
had been dead a year, was by his side; she saw he had something
green in his hand, and she asked him to share it with her, for a
poor girl, her &ldquo;young lady,&rdquo; the
sergeant-major&rsquo;s daughter, who was dying!</p>
<p>The veteran did as she desired; but the bow was <i>yew</i>,
not laurel.&nbsp; Well versed in omens, she returned it to him,
burst into tears, and ran on.&nbsp; He had heard that Miss Lucy
was ill; but age is often forgetful; he had not thought of it;
yet now, the memory of the past rushed into his heart, and he
discovered so quickly where &ldquo;Irish Mary&rdquo; lived, that
when she was home again, with a fresh green sprig of laurel,
James Hardy was weeping bitterly by Lucy&rsquo;s side, while Lucy
was in an ecstacy of joy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her father,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;had come for her; there should be no more sorrow, no
more pain; no more want for Mary or for her; her dear father had
come for her.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>By a strong effort, she laid her head
on James Hardy&rsquo;s shoulder, and grasped her nurse&rsquo;s
hard, honest hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I come, my <span
class="GutSmall">FATHER</span>!&rdquo; she exclaimed, and all was
over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To die so, in her prime, her youth, her beauty; to be
left to die, because they say there&rsquo;s no cure for it; <span
class="GutSmall">THEY NEVER TRIED TO CURE HER</span>!&rdquo;
exclaimed the nurse, between her bursts of grief&mdash;&ldquo;no
place to shelter her&mdash;no one to see to her&mdash;no proper
food, or air, or care&mdash;my heart&rsquo;s jewel&mdash;who
cared for all, when she had it!&nbsp; Still, the Lord is
merciful; another week, and I should have had nothing but a drop
of cold water to moisten her lips, and no bed for her to lie
on.&nbsp; I kept <i>that</i> to the last, anyhow; and now it may
go; it must go; small loss; what matter what comes of the likes
of me, when such as her could have no help!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll beg
from door to door, &rsquo;till I raise enough to lay her by her
father&rsquo;s side, in the churchyard of ould
Chelsea.&rdquo;&nbsp; But that effort, at all events, was not
needed; the hospital was astir; the sergeant-major was
remembered; and the church-bell tolled when Lucy was laid in her
father&rsquo;s grave, in the <span class="smcap">Churchyard of
Old Chelsea</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> reader of this little book must
not close it with a sad aspect.&nbsp; Thank God, there are few
griefs without some counterbalancing comforts; and this
afflicting subject, so long <i>without hope</i>, is now <span
class="GutSmall">FULL OF HOPE</span>.&nbsp; The contrasts of
life, the lights and shadows of existence, are sometimes so
strong as to be absolutely painful; yet their strength and
rapidity of change are, in many cases, blessings.&nbsp; Our
church bell the other morning had been tolling, at intervals, for
a funeral; the morning was dull and clouded, and the sound,
instead of rising through the atmosphere, boomed heavily and
gloomily along it.&nbsp; A cesssation followed: I was so occupied
that I hardly noted how long it was, when, suddenly, the joy
bells struck up, ringing out such merry music that I remembered,
at once, there was a wedding going forward that day; a right gay
bridal; rank, fashion, and wealth; love also, I had been told,
was, of a surety, there; all that young hearts desire bring
gathered together; and the bells again and again rang forth,
until the air vibrated.&nbsp; At first the change was very
painful; so sudden, and startling, and jarring, that I longed to
shut it out; but when I opened my window and looked forth, the
contrast of sight was as great as was that of sound; the clouds
were floating away in the distance, and around <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>us all was
light!&nbsp; I was almost angry with myself for feeling so
immediately happy; but, after the lapse of a few minutes, the
heaviness of the past was superseded by the joyfulness of the
present.&nbsp; The evening came in due time, with its sober hues
and tones, and I had leisure to think over the doleful knell and
the marriage ringings; and then, indeed, I saw, with gratitude to
Him who orders all things for the best, how wise it is that the
tear should be followed by the smile, and that cause for sorrow
should be succeeded by motive for joy!</p>
<p>How many and how marvellous are the changes that ten years
have wrought.&nbsp; New sympathies have been awakened; a new
spirit has been hovering above us and around us, with
&ldquo;healing on its wings.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ten years
ago&mdash;women and children slaved in our coal mines, degraded
far below the level of &ldquo;brutes that perish;&rdquo; women,
harnessed to their loads, crawling like reptiles along damps and
slimes, underneath the earth: children, whose weak and
&ldquo;winking&rdquo; eyes had never seen the light, with minds
as dark as the strata wherein they toiled!&nbsp; Ten years
ago&mdash;the loom, too, hid its victims far away out of
Humanity&rsquo;s sight, in the sole keeping of those who, in
their thirst for &ldquo;gold, more gold,&rdquo; made their
alchemy of infant sinews, and sweats from the brow of age.&nbsp;
Ten years ago&mdash;the shopman&mdash;in the hot summer time,
centred in the crowded thoroughfare, where dust and air so
closely mingle that they are inhaled together from sunrise to
midnight&mdash;laboured for eighteen hours; an item of
God&rsquo;s creation for whom there was no care; never, during
the six days of his master&rsquo;s week, seeing the faces of his
children, save in sleep, and too worn, too weary, when the
sabbath came, to find it a day of rest.&nbsp; How long was the
prayer unanswered,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Give me one hour of rest from toil,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From daily toil for daily bread;<br />
Untwisting Labour&rsquo;s heavy coil<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From round the heart and head!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ten years ago&mdash;no voice was raised for mercy to the lone
sempstress; sure &ldquo;slave of the lamp;&rdquo; working from
&ldquo;weary chime to chime;&rdquo; bearing her cross in
solitude&mdash;toiling, while starving, for the few soiled pence,
the very touch of which would be contamination to the kidded
hands of tawdry footmen; these poor women sunk into their graves,
they and their famished children, unmissed of any, for there were
none to ask where they were gone.&nbsp; Ten years ago&mdash;and
the governess, in age, in poverty, in sickness, had no
refuge&mdash;no shelter, even from a storm that might have been a
passing one.&nbsp; Her life of labour&mdash;labour of head, eyes,
hands, and tongue; toil without rest&mdash;uncheered,
unappreciated, unrecompensed, which left</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;No leisure to be
gay or glad,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>followed by a deserted sick bed; a death, unmarked by any
kindly eye, and a coffin <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>grudged for its cost.&nbsp; Such was
her too common lot!&nbsp; Ten years ago, the poor dressmaker
fagged out her life; fainting during her brief minutes of
&ldquo;rest;&rdquo; standing when sleepy, while one, of more
robust strength than her companions, stalked about the thronged
and ill-ventilated work-room, till past midnight, touching those
whose fingers relax, and whispering the warning
sound&mdash;&ldquo;Wake up&mdash;wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Need we prolong this list&mdash;this contrast, appalling yet
glorious, of the present time with ten years ago?&nbsp; One more
must be added to it presently.</p>
<p>Ten years have, indeed, wrought many and marvellous changes, A
cry has been raised throughout the Empire, <span
class="GutSmall">NOT BY THE POOR BUT FOR THE POOR</span>; not by
the oppressed, but for them!&nbsp; It was a righteous cry, and
holy are the sympathies it has awakened; sympathies which convey
our superfluous riches to that storehouse where neither moth nor
rust can corrupt; convincing us that, while a closed heart is
never happy, a hand open as day to melting charity, secures a
mightier reward than the wealth of Cr&oelig;sus can purchase!</p>
<p>There is, then, one newly-awakened sympathy to be yet added to
the <span class="GutSmall">LIST</span>, of which, in preceding
remarks, I have given only an abridgement.&nbsp; Ten years
ago&mdash;nay, <span class="GutSmall">THREE</span> years
ago&mdash;the poor woman or man, who had been stricken with <span
class="GutSmall">CONSUMPTION</span> was left to perish.&nbsp; For
her or for him there was literally &ldquo;no hope.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Every other ailment was cared for&mdash;<i>might</i> be
&ldquo;taken in time.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this terrible disease was,
like the leprosy of old, or the plague in modern times&mdash;a
signal for the sufferer to be deserted, abandoned in
despair.&nbsp; Blessed be the God of mercy, such is not the case
now; a &ldquo;new sympathy,&rdquo; has been awakened, and, by the
aid of a merciful Providence, it has spread widely!&nbsp; An
establishment, hitherto conducted on a small scale, but hereafter
to be in a degree commensurate with the <span
class="GutSmall">WANT</span>, exists in this Metropolis, where
the patient will not apply for help in vain.&nbsp; It is
sufficiently notorious that nearly all the great projects which
have given pre-eminence to this country, and have made
it&mdash;as it has been, is, and, by God&rsquo;s help, ever will
be&mdash;the envy and admiration of surrounding states, have been
the births of private enterprise.&nbsp; It is so in science, in
literature, in the arts, and, above all, in charity.&nbsp; Some
one man, more thoughtful, more energetic, and more indefatigable
than the great mass of his fellow men, stirs the hearts of
others, sets himself and them to the great work of improvement,
or mercy&mdash;and the thing is done.&nbsp; If we recur to the
several leading public charities, we shall find that all, or
nearly all, of them, have thus originated; the names of their
founders have been handed down to posterity, and individuals,
comparatively insignificant and obscure, are classed as
benefactors to mankind, entitled to, and receiving, the gratitude
of a whole people.</p>
<p>Thus the name of a poor player, whose monument is at Dulwich,
has been made famous for ages; that of a humble sea-captain is
identified with the preservation of <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>the lives of tens of thousands of
foundlings; while that of a simple miniature painter is for ever
linked with the history of practical
&ldquo;Benevolence.&rdquo;&nbsp; The list might include nearly
the whole of the charities of London, which, from similar small
sources, have become mighty waters&mdash;spreading, healing,
fertilizing, and blessing!</p>
<p>The absence of a hospital for the relief and cure of
consumptive patients, was a national reproach; when, happily,
exertions which followed the efforts of a single individual
removed it.&nbsp; He was without rank or fortune to give weight
and strength to the cause he had undertaken; he was a member of a
profession which necessarily occupied much time and
thought&mdash;entailed daily labour from morn till
night&mdash;and is, indeed, supposed, however falsely, to check
and chill the sympathies of the natural heart, engendering
indifference to human suffering.&nbsp; Most happily, his mind and
heart were both rightly directed: in him the conviction of what
ought to be was followed by a resolution that it should be; his
generous and merciful feelings were not limited to good
intentions: he added energy to zeal, and industry to stern
resolve; and, in a word, the mighty object has been accomplished.
<a name="citation26a"></a><a href="#footnote26a"
class="citation">[26a]</a>&nbsp; The Institution, which
originated at a small meeting, in a comparatively humble house in
&ldquo;Hans-place, Chelsea,&rdquo; is now the patronized of the
Queen, and the aided of the people; and its power to do good has
been marvellously augmented.&nbsp; Even with the very limited
means hitherto at the command of its Directors, prodigious
service has been rendered; in numerous instances, vast relief has
been afforded; in some cases restorations to health have been
effected, and, in others, the passage to the grave has been made
easy, tranquil, and happy. <a name="citation26b"></a><a
href="#footnote26b" class="citation">[26b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>And
surely this latter consideration is one of very vital
importance.&nbsp; Not only is the chaplain of the Institution
aided earnestly by the matron and other excellent ladies, who
read and pray, and soothe and comfort the fainting and struggling
spirit; but no distinction of creeds is here made&mdash;where
death is so often busied in levelling all distinctions; a
clergyman of the Roman Catholic faith, and ministers of all
Christian societies and sects, are gladly admitted whenever
members of their congregations require spiritual comfort and aid.
<a name="citation27a"></a><a href="#footnote27a"
class="citation">[27a]</a>&nbsp; Who is there, then, with mind
and heart influenced by religion, who will not rejoice at
opportunities of soothing a dying-bed&mdash;removing misery,
alleviating pain, and averting want, while preparing for a change
of time for eternity?&nbsp; The yet limited chronicles of this
infant Institution record many touching instances of courage,
encouragement, hope, and salvation, obtained there, while passing
through the valley of the shadow of death.&nbsp; The fatal
disease gives abundant time for such consolations and such
results; the tyrant advances slowly; the issue has been long
foreseen; there is no need to hurry or confuse; divine grace may
be infused surely&mdash;the mists of unbelief being gradually
dispelled; bright and cheering gospel truths may be learned, one
by one, until the last sigh wafts the soul into the haven
&ldquo;prepared by the blood of the Lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But temporal, as well as eternal good, has been already
achieved by this Institution.&nbsp; Several of its inmates have
been discharged, fitted to become useful members of society;
strengthened in constitution as well as spiritually enlightened;
beneficially changed, in all respects, by a temporary residence
in this blessed Asylum.&nbsp; I have seen, not one or two, but
several, pale faces return, after a sojourn in the Hospital, to
thank me for &ldquo;my letter,&rdquo; with the hues of health
upon their cheeks, and able to bless the Institution, without
pausing to breathe between the breaks in every sentence.</p>
<p>There is, however, a consideration connected with the subject
which presses sorely on the mind of every inhabitant of these
islands&mdash;rich as well as poor&mdash;for no station in exempt
from the influence of the subtle disease; no blood, however
ancient and pure, can repel it; exemption from its attacks cannot
be purchased by any excess of wealth; caution can do little to
avert it; its advances are perceived afar off without a prospect
of escape; it seems, indeed, the terrible vanquisher against whom
it is idle to fight. <a name="citation27b"></a><a
href="#footnote27b" class="citation">[27b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>Surely,
then, <span class="GutSmall">ALL</span> are
interested&mdash;deeply interested&mdash;in helping the only plan
by which the disease may be so studied as to secure a
remedy.&nbsp; It is foolish to speak of it as <span
class="GutSmall">INCURABLE</span>; the term signifies only that
the cure has not been yet discovered; there are scores of other
diseases which, half a century ago, were regarded as consumption
now is&mdash;sure steps to death, for which the physician could
do nothing.&nbsp; How many seeming miracles has simple science
worked in our day!&nbsp; Why have other diseases been completely
conquered, while this maintains its power unchecked?&nbsp; Merely
because, in reference to the one, ample opportunities for
studying them have been of late years afforded, while, with
regard to the other, a single case at a time was all the
physician could take for his guidance.&nbsp; Now, in this
Institution, a school is forming, to which it is not too much to
say, even the most healthy and beautiful children of our highest
nobles may be indebted for life; for who can say how soon a
slight cold may sow the seeds of consumption, which skill may
fail to baffle and subdue until greater knowledge has been
supplied by means more enlarged and more effectual than as yet
exist in the kingdoms swayed by a royal lady, who is at once the
pride and the model of British wives and mothers?</p>
<p>To all our interests, then&mdash;of time and of
eternity&mdash;this <span class="GutSmall">CHARITY</span> makes
earnest and eloquent appeal.&nbsp; Surely these considerations
will have their weight in obtaining all-sufficient aid to create
and sustain the Institution it is my happy privilege to
advocate&mdash;in humble but earnest hope that my weak advocacy
may not be altogether vain.</p>

established about the year 1673, in England.&nbsp; In a very old
manuscript the spot is thus quaintly
described:&mdash;&ldquo;Chelsea physic garden has great variety
of plants, both in and out of green-houses; their perennial green
hedges, and rows of different coloured herbs, are very pretty,
and so are the banks set with shades of herbs in the Irish
style.&rdquo;&nbsp; The drawing Mr. Fairholt was so good as to
make for this little book, gives a faithful representation of the
statue of Sir Hans Sloane, by Rysbach, the two famous cedars, and
the water-gate; and as this time-honoured garden is about to be
converted into &ldquo;a square of houses,&rdquo; I am glad of the
opportunity to preserve a memorial of it.&nbsp; It is not only
sacred to science, but full of pleasant memories: Evelyn has sate
beneath those cedars; Sir Joseph Banks used to delight in
measuring them, and proving to his friends that the girth of the
larger &ldquo;exceeded twelve feet eleven inches;&rdquo; and it
is said that, when Dean Swift lodged at Chelsea, he was often to
be found in this &ldquo;physic garden.&rdquo;&nbsp; When we call
to mind the number of persons of note who selected the
&ldquo;sweet village of Chelsea&rdquo; as a residence, there can
he no lack of associations for this spot.&nbsp; Between the
garden and the college is the place (according to Maitland) where
C&aelig;sar crossed the Thames.</p>

class="footnote">[26b]</a>&nbsp; Independent of advantages
afforded within the present Hospital, application for orders to
obtain &ldquo;out of door&rdquo; advice and medicine have been
very numerous; and they have not unfrequently been made by
persons far superior to those who are supposed (but most
erroneously) to be the only recipients of charitable aid.&nbsp; I
entreat the reader&rsquo;s indulgence while I briefly relate one
circumstance within my own knowledge.&nbsp; A few months ago, a
lady (for poverty is no destroyer of birth-rights) requested from
me a ticket for an out-door patient; and, in answer to my
inquiries, at length, with trembling lips and streaming eyes,
confessed it was for her husband she needed it.&nbsp; She had
made what is called a <i>love-match</i>; her family refused to do
anything to alleviate the poverty which followed his misfortunes,
unless she forsook her husband; her knowledge of the most sacred
duty of woman&rsquo;s life, and, indeed, I believe, poor thing,
her enduring love, prevented her having the great sin to answer
for, of abandoning him in his distress; and her skill in drawing
and embroidery enabled her to support her sick husband and
herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can do <i>that</i>,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and procure him even little luxuries, if I have not a
doctor&rsquo;s bill to pay; but the medicines are so expensive,
that he will be comfortless unless we can receive aid from this
Institution; I have paid, during the last two weeks, twelve
shillings for medicine.&rdquo;&nbsp; His case was utterly and
entirely without hope, but, as she told me afterwards, no words
could express the alleviation to his sufferings, mental and
physical, which followed the assistance he obtained at the
Hospital.</p>

when the mind is, perhaps, best adapted to receive, with benefit,
the divine truths of religion, and to enable those who depend

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
